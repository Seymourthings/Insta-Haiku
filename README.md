# Insta-Haiku

A simple web app that takes in a word and returns the approximate syllable count and a visual haiku of images
grabbed from Instagram. 

The user submitted word should have no spaces in between letters as it will not fetch any instagram pictures.
It will only estimate the number of syllables. The reason being that the images are fetched by hashtags with 
the user submitted word. Hashtag phrases do not have spaces in between words and so images will be returned.

Inappropriate phrases/words do not return images.

Still working on displaying the images in a 5-7-5 format.
