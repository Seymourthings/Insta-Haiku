# Insta-Haiku

A simple web app that takes in a word and returns the approximate syllable count and a visual haiku of images
grabbed from Instagram. 

The user should enter a word or phrase as they would when writing a hashtag on Instagram: no spaces between letters and no characters besides letters.

Inappropriate phrases/words do not return images.
